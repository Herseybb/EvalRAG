Does the TechCrunch article on Twitch's subscription revenue split policy indicate a different monetization strategy compared to the TechCrunch article on Beeper's plans for Beeper Mini subscriptions?,"The TechCrunch article on Twitch's subscription revenue split policy indicates a monetization strategy that has evolved in response to community feedback and competitive pressures. Twitch has shifted its focus towards a blend of subscription revenues and ad revenue, altering its subscription models and eligibility criteria for creators in a way that aims to balance the needs of both the platform and the creators. This includes introducing programs like Partner Plus and adjusting how subscriptions are valued based on their price points.
